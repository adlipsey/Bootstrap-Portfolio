						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<hr>
						<img src="./assets/images/ADL.JPG" alt="Picture of Andrew Lipsey" class="bio-pic">
						<p>My coding journey began all they way back in 1998 when I was tasked with creating a webpage using HTML for a class assignment. I had no idea what HTML tags were, I didn't know how to incorporate images, and, worst of all, I didn't know webpages needed to be hosted in order for anyone other than myself to see them. From the multitude of mistakes I made in that project sprung a desire to learn everything possible about HTML and all of its capabilities. My next several projects were awash in scrolling marquees, "Under Construction" gifs, and embedded midi files of popular 80's and 90's songs; truly the pinnacle of late-90's webmaster-y. Thoroughly satisfied with my stunning HTML capabilities, I set my sights on other pursuits.</p>
						<p>I moved on to Computer Science for two years in late high school hoping to learn how to "Hack the Planet" using C++, but really only learned about data structures and algorithmic efficiency. I spent the next several years through college poking around from language to language, but always returning to HTML either for personal use or whenever my employer realized I could easily manipulate web content for less pay than a professional.</p> 
						<p>After years of unfulfilling jobs where my coding skills were either exploited, wasted, or both, a friend introduced me to Ruby and the possibility of coding for a living. I taught myself enough to code a simple program that can count the Hamming Distance (the number of nucleotides that are not exact matches) in DNA chanins and realized I needed to code for a living. Now in the process of becoming a full-stack developer, I hope to find a place to put my newfound front-end and back-end skills to use.</p>
